# kobo-toolchain

[![Build Status](https://drone.aricodes.net/api/badges/aricodes-oss/kobo-toolchain/status.svg)](https://drone.aricodes.net/aricodes-oss/kobo-toolchain)

Made for the excellent [Kobo-UNCaGED](https://github.com/shermp/kobo-uncaged) project to ease their CI/CD needs. This builds the base toolchain that they need to build their project, which is time consuming and hardware intensive.

For more information please check the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/aricodes-oss/kobo-toolchain) and the project this builds, [koxtoolchain](https://github.com/koreader/koxtoolchain).
